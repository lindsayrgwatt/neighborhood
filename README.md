# Introduction

This project aggregates Seattle's Open Data and shows you what is happening on a per-neighborhood basis.

The software is written in Django and optimized for rapid deployment on [dotcloud](https://www.dotcloud.com). See DEPLOY for full instructions on how to run both locally and in the cloud.
